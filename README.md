# Imageine Craft Launcher

An open source Minecraft launcher initially made for the [Imageine Team](https://imagine.team)<br>
You can test it out right here! [Launcher Page](http://launcher.imagine.team). Download it and give it a good test drive! If you are interested in using it give us a nod and share where you got the source! It's not required but nice. A lot of time and planning went into it. With more planned to  be relesed soon!<br>
The launcher comes as is. The issues we accept and will respond to are only improvment related. If it breaks for you than try to fix it first before spamming us with issues!
## Here are some nice screanshots to see!
